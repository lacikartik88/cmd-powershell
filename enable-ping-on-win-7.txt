Anyway, here is how I enabled ping response in Windows 7:

Control Panel --> System and security --> Windows Firewall --> Advanced settings --> Inbound rules --> New rule --> custom rule

in Protocol and ports: Protocol: ICMPv4
on the same panel go to customize, choose "Specific ICMP types", check the box "echo request"

The rest is trivial; go to next... next... and save it.

You should be done. This box responds ping from this point on.
